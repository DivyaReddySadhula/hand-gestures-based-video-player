**Purpose**

The purpose of this project was to detect hands in images/videos without using Machine/Deep Learning. So, this has been done using only Image Processing, and it is much faster than ML/DL solutions on a normal system. However, it is not as as accurate (backgrounds with similar color as that of skin can fool the detector). Also note that, this isn't really a "Hand detector". It is just an Object Detector, using color. You can play around and modify the code to detect other objects as well, pretty easily.
